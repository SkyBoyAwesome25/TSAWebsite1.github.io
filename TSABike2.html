            <p class="review">I am a professional mountain biker, and I invested in the Eco Expedition Electric Mountain Bike. It said delivered at my house, and when I went to check I hadn’t seen a package. The next day I called customer service and they said it was there. Well there was something there, but it wasn’t a bike it was a package of bike accessories addressed to someone from Oklahoma.</p>

            <p class="review">The product is good, not saying it’s not worth it to save the environment. All I am saying is that the battery I received was faulty and I ended up getting stuck at a bistro since the battery pack died that was supposedly fully charged according to the directions I followed. I charged it for the entire time the night before. Just saying, although the new one I got is much, much better. The bike is still a great deal and worth every penny</p>
