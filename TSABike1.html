            <p class="review">Oh my goodness, this product is legit. I have to say the service is amazing, and their information page is very eye opening to what’s happening with our environment. It’s actually what convinced me to try an electric bike. I hope that by doing this small change it’ll spark a big one for everyone else skeptical about it. #gogreen.</p>

            <p class="review">This is an excellent product, and ultimately the most useful tool I have ever owned. It is true what they say, traffic is a nightmare, (was a nightmare) but now that I have the Speed Demon 590 STar Roadster, I can easily travel without the hassle. Thank you VBikes! (I’m ordering the Speed Demon FaST series version 2.0: Laser Canary 360 right now!) </p>
